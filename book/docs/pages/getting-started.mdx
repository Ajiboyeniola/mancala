# RoR: Mancala

Mancala is a classic strategy board game reimagined as a decentralized, on-chain experience. Built with Cairo smart contracts on the Dojo game engine, it leverages blockchain technology for secure gameplay and global state.

The project's MIT and CC0 licenses foster open-source development and maximum accessibility.
