# Game Play

## Objective:

Have the most stones in your store after all the stones on either side of the game board are captured.

## Game rules:

Setup:
Place 4 stones in each of the 12 pits. Leave the 2 stores ( mancala ) at both ends empty.

### In-game:

Roll a dice, the person with the highest number starts the game.
Game is played counter-clockwise.
Each player takes turns to choose any pit in their corner and puts one stone in the next++ pits until they run out of stones.
Once the player runs out of stones for their turn, check if the player can capture any stones from the opponent`s store.

### Capturing stones:

If you place the last stone of your turn into an empty pit on your side of the board, you capture all of the stones in the pit directly across from it on the opponentâ€™s side of the board. Take the captured stones and the capturing stones, and place it in your store.

### End:

The game ends when either of the player has no more stones in their pit
